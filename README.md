## Mojave Dynamic Wallpaper

Simple, time-based, macOS style dynamic wallpaper that transitions between the dark and light versions of macOS Catalina's default wallpapers. It also sets the lock screen background to the same image as the desktop background for a consistent look. Designed to be used with [KDEasyMc](https://github.com/caglarturali/KDEasyMc).

### Concept

Explain code

```bash
BIN_DIR="${HOME}/.local/bin"
THEMES_DIR="${HOME}/.local/share/wallpapers"
AUTOSTART_DIR="${HOME}/.config/autostart"
AUTOSTART_SCRIPTS_DIR="${HOME}/.config/autostart-scripts"
```

`BIN_DIR` bin is for your command (binary command)
`THEMES_DIR` is for wallpaper set
`AUTOSTART_DIR` is for desktop file (exec on directory AUTOSTART_SCRIPTS_DIR)
`AUTOSTART_SCRIPTS_DIR` is for symlink script from `BIN_DIR`

if you uninstall (using command `catalina -u`) all of files in directory above will be removed
and dont forget to restart your pc

| OPTIONS:        |                                                         |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| -s, --start     | Start dynamic wallpaper.                                |
| -p, --stop      | Stop dynamic wallpaper.                                 |
| -u, --uninstall | Uninstall dynamic wallpaper. Removes all related files. |

### Notes

- On DDE, it only sets the desktop background. You need to set the lock screen background manually, for now.
